			<h4 id="texttoread">INFOMATION PLEASE READ THIS</h4>
			<P>welcome to my website I am the creater of this website I love to code and learn new coding languages. I dont know why
				I love to code. but I do know it comes easy to me. It is the most easy thing to me to-do it like english it comes easy
				if you understand it. but there is alot to remember if you start to learn to code, that is the only hard thing to do
				for to remember all the tags that are used in coding. this will not be updated every day. this will take a long to do
				but ill work on this when i am at home to just got to set up a schedule. it wont be big up dates but little update because
				i get home at 7 something and i want to watch some anime befor bed so it will be like a small updates. I put my email
				in the second detail tab on the footer also my phone number on the second on so you guy wont have to allway email me
				you just can just text or call. so the updates will roll out when i am at school some where around 7:30am until 12:08pm
				and after school near 7:30pm to 9:00pm but this is not set in stone so dont think i will update it at this times i do
				have stuff todo. but ill try to get a update out when i can but it will not be a big update but when it is ill tell you.
				<b id="highlight">also there is a way to contact me by email i think already said this but ill tell you again at the bottom there is a two details tabs the second one click on this to send me a email it will ask you to send it again but this is the right time to check if you spelled everything right and make sure you told me everything you wanted</b>. sorry that was long but i had to make sure you saw that and tell you. also one more thing to remind you of is <b id="highlight"> my phone number is in the first detail tab.</b> </P>
